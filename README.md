# Tic Tac Toe Bot
This is a tic-tac-toe bot I made in JavaScript and HTML. The bot controls the o's and the player controls the x's. The player goes first. The bot decides on the best move using the minimax algorithm, and will always either win or draw. To run this program, download the files and open the HTML file in your browser.
